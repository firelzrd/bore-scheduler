Description:    Read-only. Attribute group to describe the magic bits
                that go into perf_event_attr.config for a particular pmu.
                (See ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-event_source-devices-format).

                Each attribute under this group defines a bit range of the
                perf_event_attr.config. Supported attribute are listed
                below::

                  event = "config:0-31" - event ID

                For example::

                  l1_to_l2_lat = "event=0x1"

Description:    Read-only. Attribute group to describe performance monitoring
                events for the Virtual Processor Area events. Each attribute
                in this group describes a single performance monitoring event
                supported by vpa_pmu. The name of the file is the name of
                the event (See ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-event_source-devices-events).
