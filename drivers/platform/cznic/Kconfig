	  Say Y here to be able to choose driver support for CZ.NIC's Turris
	  devices. This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  Say Y here to add support for the features implemented by the
	  microcontroller on the CZ.NIC's Turris Omnia SOHO router.
	  The features include:
	  - board poweroff into true low power mode (with voltage regulators
	    disabled) and the ability to configure wake up from this mode (via
	    rtcwake)
	  - true random number generator (if available on the MCU)
	  - MCU watchdog
	  - GPIO pins
	    - to get front button press events (the front button can be
	      configured either to generate press events to the CPU or to change
	      front LEDs panel brightness)
	    - to enable / disable USB port voltage regulators and to detect
	      USB overcurrent
	    - to detect MiniPCIe / mSATA card presence in MiniPCIe port 0
	    - to configure resets of various peripherals on board revisions 32+
	    - to enable / disable the VHV voltage regulator to the SOC in order
	      to be able to program SOC's OTP on board revisions 32+
	    - to get input from the LED output pins of the WAN ethernet PHY, LAN
	      switch and MiniPCIe ports
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here; the module will be
	  called turris-omnia-mcu.
