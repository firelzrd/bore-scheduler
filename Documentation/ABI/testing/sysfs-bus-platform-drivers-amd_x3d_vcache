Description:	(RW) AMD 3D V-Cache optimizer allows users to switch CPU core
		rankings dynamically.

		This file switches between these two modes:
		- "frequency" cores within the faster CCD are prioritized before
		those in the slower CCD.
		- "cache" cores within the larger L3 CCD are prioritized before
		those in the smaller L3 CCD.
