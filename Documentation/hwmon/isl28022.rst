Description
-----------

The ISL28022 is a power monitor with I2C interface. The device monitors
voltage, current via shunt resistor and calculated power.

Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate the
device explicitly. Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices.rst for
details.

The shunt value in micro-ohms, shunt voltage range and averaging can be set
with device properties.
Please refer to the Documentation/devicetree/bindings/hwmon/isl,isl28022.yaml
for bindings if the device tree is used.

The driver supports only shunt and bus continuous ADC mode at 15bit resolution.
Averaging can be set from 1 to 128 samples (power of 2) on both channels.
Shunt voltage range of 40, 80, 160 or 320mV is allowed
The bus voltage range is 60V fixed.
