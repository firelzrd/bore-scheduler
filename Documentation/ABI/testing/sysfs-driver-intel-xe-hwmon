Date:		September 2023
KernelVersion:	6.5
Contact:	intel-xe@lists.freedesktop.org
Description:	RW. Card reactive sustained  (PL1) power limit in microwatts.

		The power controller will throttle the operating frequency
		if the power averaged over a window (typically seconds)
		exceeds this limit. A read value of 0 means that the PL1
		power limit is disabled, writing 0 disables the
		limit. Writing values > 0 and <= TDP will enable the power limit.

		Only supported for particular Intel xe graphics platforms.
