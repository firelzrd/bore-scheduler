Date:		April 2005 (predates git)
KernelVersion:	2.6.12-rc2 (predates git)
Contact:	selinux@vger.kernel.org
Description:

	The selinuxfs "user" node allows userspace to request a list
	of security contexts that can be reached for a given SELinux
	user from a given starting context. This was used by libselinux
	when various login-style programs requested contexts for
	users, but libselinux stopped using it in 2020.
	Kernel support will be removed no sooner than Dec 2025.
