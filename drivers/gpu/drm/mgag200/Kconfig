	 MGA G200 desktop chips and the server variants. It requires 0.3.0

	  Enable a workaround to avoid I/O bursts within the mgag200 driver at
	  the expense of overall display performance.
	  It restores the <v5.10 behavior, by mapping the framebuffer in system
	  RAM as Write-Combining, and flushing the cache after each write.
	  This is only useful on x86_64 if you want to run processes with
	  deterministic latency.
	  If unsure, say N.
