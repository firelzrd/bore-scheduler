Date:		March 2023
Contact:	nipun.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		Writing y/1/on to this file will cause rescan of the bus
		and devices on the CDX bus. Any new devices are scanned and
		added to the list of Linux devices and any devices removed are
		also deleted from Linux.

		For example::

		  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/cdx/rescan

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../vendor

Description:
		Vendor ID for this CDX device, in hexadecimal. Vendor ID is
		16 bit identifier which is specific to the device manufacturer.
		Combination of Vendor ID and Device ID identifies a device.

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../device
Date:		March 2023

Description:
		Device ID for this CDX device, in hexadecimal. Device ID is
		16 bit identifier to identify a device type within the range
		of a device manufacturer.
		Combination of Vendor ID and Device ID identifies a device.

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../subsystem_vendor
Date:		July 2023

Description:
		Subsystem Vendor ID for this CDX device, in hexadecimal.
		Subsystem Vendor ID is 16 bit identifier specific to the
		card manufacturer.

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../subsystem_device

Description:
		Subsystem Device ID for this CDX device, in hexadecimal
		Subsystem Device ID is 16 bit identifier specific to the
		card manufacturer.

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../class
Date:		July 2023
Contact:	puneet.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		This file contains the class of the CDX device, in hexadecimal.
		Class is 24 bit identifier specifies the functionality of the device.

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../revision
Date:		July 2023
Contact:	puneet.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		This file contains the revision field of the CDX device, in hexadecimal.
		Revision is 8 bit revision identifier of the device.

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../enable
Date:		October 2023
Contact:	abhijit.gangurde@amd.com
Description:
		CDX bus should be disabled before updating the devices in FPGA.
		Writing n/0/off will attempt to disable the CDX bus and.
		writing y/1/on will attempt to enable the CDX bus. Reading this file
		gives the current state of the bus, 1 for enabled and 0 for disabled.

		For example::

		  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/cdx/.../enable

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../reset
Date:		March 2023
Contact:	nipun.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		Writing y/1/on to this file resets the CDX device or all devices
		on the bus. On resetting the device, the corresponding driver is
		notified twice, once before the device is being reset, and again
		after the reset has been complete.

		For example::

		  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/cdx/.../reset

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../remove
Date:		March 2023
Contact:	tarak.reddy@amd.com
Description:
		Writing y/1/on to this file removes the corresponding
		device from the CDX bus. If the device is to be reconfigured
		reconfigured in the Hardware, the device can be removed, so
		that the device driver does not access the device while it is
		being reconfigured.

		For example::

		  # echo 1 > /sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../remove

What:		/sys/bus/cdx/devices/.../modalias
Date:		July 2023
Contact:	nipun.gupta@amd.com
Description:
		This attribute indicates the CDX ID of the device.
		That is in the format:
		cdx:vXXXXdXXXXsvXXXXsdXXXXcXXXXXX,
		where:

		    - vXXXX contains the vendor ID;
		    - dXXXX contains the device ID;
		    - svXXXX contains the subsystem vendor ID;
		    - sdXXXX contains the subsystem device ID;
		    - cXXXXXX contains the device class.
